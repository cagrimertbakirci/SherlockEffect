# SherlockEffect
This is the code that generates BBC's Sherlock series' character or word matching effect.

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. The user calls the function with the word or sentence they want to apply the effect to.
2. Once the function called, the user can see the effect in the command window. 
3. As of now, the code follows a brute force algorithm and not a specialized trial-and-error method.
  
Future Developments
1. Eliminate the failed characters from the pool to speed it up.
2. Add an option to make sure the letters match from left-to-right and not in random order (for artistic purposes).
3. Make it executable outside of MATLAB.
